Basic description of the test scenarios, videos from the camera and radar data. bouding box examples.
## Scenarios
The use of test scenarios belonging to the EURONCAP test protocols enables valid and useful
comparisons between tests in different facilities and weather
conditions.
### EURONCAP Scenarios
In this work we recorded eight different test scenarios, three of
which are inspired in the EURONCAP test protocols:

- Car-to-Bicyclist Longitudinal Adult 50% (CBLA-50):

## Others Scenarios:

With the ego-vehicle static was recorded four types of objects:
car, cyclist, truck and pedestrian.
The recordings were made with the objects initially positioned in
front of the ego-vehicle and then moving away. For the bicyclist,
pedestrian and truck was utilized the GNSS SP80 sensor in order
to get the ground-truth position.
